      <h1>Bridging the PC vs Console divide with the Steam Deck</h1>

          Two months ago, Valve announced the <strong>Steam Deck</strong>, a product that could change the future of gaming forever. For a long time, the gaming world has been rigidly separated based on platform - PC vs consoles. The Steam Deck is envisioned at bridging the gap between consoles and PCs. It is a handheld gaming console (similar to the Nintendo Switch), which runs the Steam OS operating system and allows users to play all games on the Steam marketplace. What this means is that the Steam Deck is essentially a PC that can be handheld and allows you to play games, allowing you to combine the convenience of a console with the performance and game library typically available only on PC.

          It will be interesting to note how the big console producers react to this product. Since the Steam Deck combines both convenience and performance, the only weapon left with major console manufacturers is control over their game libraries. We can expect Sony to react with  more exclusive games that are locked to the PS5, while Microsoft might choose to focus on their cloud gaming project and future proof their business by reducing their dependence on console hardware. The company that might get left behind is Nintendo, which has seen its only major USP (convenience) get nullified by Valve.</div>
