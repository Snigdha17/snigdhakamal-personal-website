      <h1>The case against Instagram Kids</h1>
      <small>September 29, 2021</small>
      <p class="para-desc">
        <div class = "blog-div">Two days ago, Facebook announced that they were pausing the development
        of their Instagram Kids app, which was supposed to be a version of
        Instagram built for children under the age of 13. The pause was probably
        due to the backlash from policymakers, regulators and child safety
        groups who were concerned about the rampant bullying and body shaming
        that children (especially girls) face on social media.
      </div> 

        <div class = "blog-div">However, FB's stance on this is that building a social media app for kids is still the
        "right thing to do", and they are only pausing development to figure out
        what the app should be like. This stance is something I cannot agree
        with. Apps such as Instagram work on the "Hook" model, which relies on a
        cycle of "Trigger-action-reward-investment" to literally hook users by
        playing on humans' need for dopamine. The idea that it's okay to expose
        kids to this cycle from as young an age as 10-11 years, when their self
        control is not even fully formed, is extremely harmful. Early addiction
        to dopamine triggers will only make children more and more dependent on
        things that provide instant gratification, and make it even harder to
        control compulsive disorders such as addiction and obesity.</div>
